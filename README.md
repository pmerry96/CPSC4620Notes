Hello! Please commit your notes to your own branch, and I will merge them into the main repository so everything is in one central location for you. Also, to commit your notes to the repo, please follow the naming convention!

Naming Convention

<USERNAME>_CHPT#_<DATE_TAKEN>
  
  So If I make a file for chapter 3 part 1 on 5/15, my filename would be
