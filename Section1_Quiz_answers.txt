	Ans: False

If we have a superclass S that is specialized into subclasses X, Y, and Z, and that specialization is total and overlapping then…
	Ans: Multiple Select
		An entity of S must be a member of at least one of the subclasses X, Y, and Z
		An entity of S can be a member of multiple subclasses (such as X and Z)

Chpt 5 Quiz Questions
What is the formal definition of a tuple
	Ans: An ordered set of values

The order of the tuples in a relation matters, i.e. two relations with the same attributes and tuples, but the tuples are in different orders are considered different relations
	Ans: False

The order of the attributes in a tuple matters. Example: <Joe, 5, 7>!=<5,7,Joe>
	Ans: True

An Attribute in a tuple can be a set of values. An attribute can be divided further into sub-attributes
	Ans: False
